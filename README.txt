== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What if I don't have many sales each day? =

Yo is still perfect for your store, here is how it will work:

**Time Stamp** - Only recent orders will display a time stamp that says how long ago it was purchased. You have the flexibility to edit this so that only orders within the last 30 minutes, 1 hour, 5 hours, 12 hours or whatever you choose to display the time stamp

**Keeping your store looking busy** - You can set Yo to display orders from the past such from one or two weeks ago (you can edit this to whatever you like) to display, and orders within that period will display, just without the time stamp. This helps your store looking lively and busy with pop-ups displaying regularly (and they're genuine orders)
**Time between orders displaying** - You can set how often orders will show up (once every 10 seconds, every 30 seconds, etc)
